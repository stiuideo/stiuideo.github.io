# The one and only Expedition 33

Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 just won The Game Awards. Not only the main prize, but 9 of them. Even though there were a lot of great games this year, deserving some or more rewards, like Kingdom Come 2, Split Fiction, Death Stranding 2, Despelote, Blue Prince, The Alters, Rematch... There are 3 things I believe:
1. There will be only one winner per category.
2. Clair deserved it. What a game.
3. This text is not about winning.


## The things that matter

In fact, I want to talk about personality and the will to propose something to the world. Pretentious as it may sound, I also make games. They are still tiny ugly games? Yes, but I'm trying my best. So, when I design them, I want to make something that has a heart, as simple as it can be. Also, I want to propose something that I haven't seem yet. At least not from that perspective.

**Yes, people will always be starving for a game similar to what they like, but once in a while we have to propose risky things in order to make room for the new. Clair did that.**

Look, I know, they didn't invent the turn-based combat or the rest of the JRPG structure, but they refreshed it, trying to say something else with all that fight dynamism when facing Nevrons and Axons. And yes, I know, they didn't invent the young-scientists-from-the-Age-of-Reason look, or even the characters' tech trinkets and their fascination with electricity. *Les Lumières*. They also didn't invent the End of The World kind of epic.
But **they made an anthropophagic move, regurgitated and offered something new with it.**


## About culture plurality and identity

As a kid, I loved to search for documentaries online. Learning not only about historical moments, but how they shaped a place's culture. Knowing that other cities, countries or continents see things in a different way than where I'm from, was splendid. Parenthood. Christmas. Childhood. Work. Death. They seem obvious to us, until we hear a wildly different perspective from a far away country, like it was common to everybody. That just made me hungry for more.

As Kleber Mendonça Filho likes to say, **the best documentaries are fictional movies**. And then all the information I had from docs made seeing international movies, from a dubious torrent I found in a even more dubious forum, delightful. Even the little things. Like a table cover, a door, a traffic sign. I was so used to just watch, hear or play americanized things that not only it excite me, but also let me dream of making Brazilian things.
At that time, the little Matheus wasn't able to decide if it would be movies, books, music... Now I know: There will be games being made.


## About inspiration from example

Besides all the incredible narrative, pace, art, gameplay, worldbuilding, soundtrack... Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 stuck with me for the same thing The Witcher did: It reminded myself of that childish time, discovering cultural identity. French and Polish, respectively. It remembered how much, someday, I want to make great fictional stories for games; talking about death, sorrow, happiness, revenge, family conflict...Inspired by our history.

That’s the power of a game that dares to propose something new, to make people dream.
