# My First Post

This is my first blog post in my homemade website.
If you can see this, I succeeded.

I built a website and somehow didn't break the internet.


## Goals

- Show my tiny solo indie cool games
- Show other art related stuff I do
- Tell stories
- Make the world a little less complicated
- Pretend I’m an authority in game dev
- Don't forget how to manage simple and clean html, old css and vanilla js


## Not Goals

- Send you invites for an unmissable masterclass
- Being serious


Seriously, don't take me serious. And make tiny games.
