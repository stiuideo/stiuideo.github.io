# STRETCH

It's always a good time to stretch, it doesn't matter how long ago the last one was. Stretching gives us room for the average. For choosing ok sentences, for having known ideas, for doing a good job. You don't even need to have a good punchline, it's just stretching.


Some writer, that I saw some time in the past, on some digital screen, probably at home, said: "I need to write for at least 4 hours before the real me come into the pages". Or something like that, the mind play tricks on us once in a while, especially when it favors our point of view. Anyway, my point is: I probably have never written for 4 hours in a row, imagine writing 4 hours before committing to a story. But now I wonder: What does she do with all those extra sentences? 4 hours of putting down in black and white, everyday, becomes quite a singular pile of paper in the office with just a few weeks. And she's a writer, she wouldn't lie about the 4 hours rule like a podcast guru, right? Right? Where does all that go? 


Even before that question, what does she write about in the stretches? Nonsense? Just random thoughts, like I do? The same story she will rewrite at work time? A new story maybe.


I like to think of myself as a character. Not me, me. Another me. Using all of the material I have about myself, trying to make some fun of it. Some call it comic relief, some call it Alan Wake style, some call it projection. Actually, my therapist calls it projection, but let's pretend I'm writing Alan Wake style, my name is Sam Lake, I'm a legendary writer and have a hot smooth cup of black coffee in my desk. One of these affirmations is true, but I won't tell which. As I was saying: I like to use myself as resource for characters that will never see the light of day. And it's a good stretching tool. 


Think about that. What you know the most in life besides yourself? Your fouls, your characteristics, your thoughts, your fears, your dreams, what makes you happy, what would you do if you had a train coming with 5 people lied down in the tracks, and the power to pull the lever for turning it to the rails next to it with only 1 innocent person. 


Stretches are meant to be easy, almost like a trance state. Just a warm up. It needs to flow, not to harm and make you sweat. So, next time you are about to write, stop it. Put the actual work aside and try stretching Alan Wake style.
